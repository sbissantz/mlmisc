# Machine Learning Nuggets

Welcome to my repository! Good to see you. As always, the plan is ambitious. In
a nutshell: I wanted to improve my machine learning skills. You may have heard
about my passion for practical R programming books. So I'll start with Bradley
Boehmke's and Brandon Greenwell's *Hands-On Machine Learning with R*[^1]. 

The book contains all the basic machine learning algorithms, so it's a good
starting point (for me). Machine learning was not on my curriculum. So I am
kind of a latecomer in this area. But this fact also means that there is still
a lot of room for personal improvement. So let's get started.

Hold on for a second. An emerging branch in the field of machine learning is
"interpretable machine learning" (IML). Christoph Molnar has already written a
book with the gripping title /Interpretable Machine Learning: A Guide for
Making Black Box Models Explainable/[^2]. This is a bold and exciting endeavor!
So I will give it a try. On that note, I'd like to close the readme with the
words of Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell: "It's not enough to find a machine
learning model that optimizes predictive performance; understanding and
confidence in model results are hallmarks of good science and necessary for our
model to be adopted."
